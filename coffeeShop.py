# Title: Cofee Shop - Teck-check #1
# Description: Console-based Python program that will simulate a coffee shop order.
                # Calculate the amount of the tip, the tax, and the total amount of a coffee shop, 
                # considering the cost per cup is $1.80. The program will prompt the user to input 
                # the number of cups they wish to order, and the tip percentage. The program will then output: 
                # 1) Total cost before tax, 2) Tax amount, 3) Tip amount (with percentage entered by the user), 
                # and 4) Final Cost of the bill, including tax and tip.
